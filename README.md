The aim of this project is to develop an efficient waste material segregation system utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to sort waste into specific categories. This approach is designed to boost recycling effectiveness, reduce environmental pollution, and encourage sustainable waste management practices.

The primary objectives include:

Precisely classifying waste materials into groups such as cardboard, glass, paper, and plastic.
Enhancing the efficiency of waste segregation to facilitate recycling and decrease landfill contributions.
Gaining insights into the characteristics of various waste materials to refine sorting techniques for greater sustainability
